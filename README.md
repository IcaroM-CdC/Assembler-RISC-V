### RISC-V is a open source instruction set architecture (ISA), developed by the university of California. This project consists in the development of an assembler for the RISC-V 32 bits ISA, made in c++, allows the conversion of the assembly language into machine language

<br>
<br>

## General registers

The RV32I base integer ISA includes 32 registers, named `x0` to `x31`. The
program counter `PC` is separate from these registers, in contrast to other
processors such as the ARM-32. The first register, `x0`, has a special function:
Reading it always returns 0 and writes to it are ignored. As we will see later,
this allows various tricks and simplifications.

In practice, the programmer doesn't use this notation for the registers. Though
`x1` to `x31` are all equally general-use registers as far as the processor is
concerned, by convention certain registers are used for special tasks. In
assembler, they are given standardized names as part of the RISC-V **application
binary interface** (ABI). This is what you will usually see in code listings. If
you really want to see the numeric register names, the `-M` argument to objdump
will provide them.

_Registers of the RV32I. Based on RISC-V documentation and Patterson and
Waterman "The RISC-V Reader" (2017)_

As a general rule, the **saved registers** `s0` to `s11` are preserved across
function calls, while the **argument registers** `a0` to `a7` and the
**temporary registers** `t0` to `t6` are not.  The use of the various
specialized registers such as `sp` by convention will be discussed later in more
detail.

## :man_technologist: Getting started

First, we need to install boost lib for c++. the Installation depends of the operating system in use.

``` bash

# cloning the repository
git clone https://github.com/IcaroM-CdC/Assembler-RISC-V.git

```

``` bash

# compiling the binaries
make compile

# executing
./assembler input_file.asm -o output_file.txt

```
if you want to print the assembled instructions, in terminal run the command

``` bash

./assembler input_file.asm

```
