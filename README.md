### RISC-V is a open source instruction set architecture (ISA), developed by the university of california. This project consists in the development of an assembler for the ISA, made in c++, allows the conversion of the assembly language into machine language


## The assembler
The assembler are developed in c++ 14, using boost library. The assembler supports some of RISC-V instructions
